# Simple Neural Network (NN)

## Overview
The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to implement a basic Neural Network (NN) from scratch using `numpy`. It is designed to demonstrate the initialization of parameters, forward propagation, backward propagation, and updating parameters within a learning algorithm for binary classification tasks.

## Features
- Parameter initialization
- Forward propagation with activation functions
- Backward propagation for error correction
- Parameter updates via gradient descent
- Model training and evaluation using `train` and `test` datasets

## Usage
Run each cell sequentially to observe how the neural network is built and how it functions.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Python libraries: `numpy` and `matplotlib`

## Input
- `X_train`, `Y_train`: Training data and labels.
- `X_test`, `Y_test`: Testing data and labels.

## Output
- Model parameters after training.
- Predictions on the testing dataset.
- Training and evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss at various iterations.

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Do not change the random seed for consist results.
